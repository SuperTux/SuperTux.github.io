## Donate

If you enjoyed playing SuperTux and would like to say thank you, or help the
project, you can donate! For now, you can use this page to donate. Later on, we
might also provide the option of "purchasing" the game via some distributor (it
would stay free and open source though).

If you don't want to use the buttons above, you can also use these details when
making your payment:

- PayPal: donations@supertuxproject.org

### Fees

Please be aware of the standard PayPal fees for low volume sales (at the time of
the last update 0.30 USD + 2.9% per transaction for payments in US dollars).
This should be taken into consideration before you are donating small amounts of
money.

### Why?

Donations help us improve the game and keep it alive. Examples of what the money
could be used for are:

- The [supertuxproject.org](https://supertuxproject.org/) domain
- Servers for hosting websites, interactive game content, and development tools
- Salary for artists that produce improved artwork
- more…
