+ New and improved backgrounds and sprites
+ Improvements to many levels in the Icy Island and forest world
+ Speed improvements for levels using a huge amount of lava tiles
+ An issue causing the bridge in the forest world to not be shown in certain cases was fixed

We urgently need more graphic designers and developers for future releases, help in these areas would be really appreciated.

A big thanks to all of our translators who worked very hard to translate the new strings in time.
