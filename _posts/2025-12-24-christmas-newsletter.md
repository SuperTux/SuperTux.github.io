Hello SuperTux Community,

As a tradition, we're releasing another Christmas Newsletter for this year.

It's been a very eventful, busy, but also incredibly productive year for the development of SuperTux. As a result of our collective hard work over the past few years, SuperTux 0.7 is right around the corner. We will soon release a beta version for everyone to try out.

0.7 will feature more improvements, graphics and features than any release of SuperTux ever before. Of course, such a big release wouldn't be possible without you - the SuperTux community. It has shaped this game to become what it is today, for which we're incredibly thankful! As such, we would like to invite you to test the upcoming beta thoroughly and report any issues on the SuperTux bug tracker (see links at the top). Also, we're always looking for new coders, testers, translators, level designers, etc. If you want to help, please consider checking out our socials (see links at the top).

Here's a summary of the changes present in SuperTux 0.7. Don't forget to check out the SuperTux Development Summary video at the end of the newsletter for an in-depth showcase of the major features and improvements. 

### Features
- Various enemies, such as the Ghoul received a full rework, alongside a plethora of bug fixes and tweaks,
- A completely revamped and modernized Level Editor (thanks to swagtoy and Tobbi),
- Introduction of the **Glinting** mechanic, to accomodate for the removal of the frag level stat,
- A completed revamp of the Yeti and Ghost Tree bosses (thanks to weluvgoatz, MatusGuy and Hypernoot)
- The completion of the graphical revamp (thanks to bruhmoent, FrostC and FilipOK)
- Reorganized credits,
- New objects (e.g. Editor Comment, Big Snowball),
    
### Music
- Even more tracks were added to the game's soundtrack from various contributors, such as bruhmoent and Servalot.

Thank you for playing SuperTux and we're looking forward to another great year of SuperTux development in 2026!
