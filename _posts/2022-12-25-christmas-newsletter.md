Almost every Christmas recently, the SuperTux Team has had an update to release.  However, this year there is unfortunately no update.  It is not because there was no progress made; it’s quite the opposite!  There are so many improvements that have been added, so many more in progress, and so many more that still have to be worked on for the next update, that it was decided best to hold off on an update for this year.

So instead of an update, here is a run-down of the progress for the next update:

## Improvements made in 2022
Most of the major improvements made to SuperTux in 2022 include:

* World select
* Local Multiplayer
* Complete revamp of tile graphics
* Sliding
* Crawling
* New iceflower behavior
* Heavy Crate
* Root Crusher
* More fish enemies
* Revamp of addon menu
* Check for updates
* New sprites for some enemies

## Works in progress
A lot of improvements are still WIP, such as:

* Finding a way to not break old levels with new graphics
* Improvements to earth flower behavior
* New backgrounds
* Keys and locked doors
* More menu improvements
* New sprites for Tux and Penny
* More new sprites for more enemies
* Updates to every level in the base game

## More improvements to be made
And some new improvements have yet to be started, such as:

* Improvements to boss behavior
* Addition of minibosses
* Inclusion of shops
* More graphics
* Other smaller features


So in short, there is still a lot of progress to be made, alongside the progress that’s already been made.  0.7.0 is going to be a relatively large update for SuperTux, and hopefully you all enjoy it when it is done.
