It's Christmas once again, meaning it's also time for our annual newsletter! Here's a summary of the most important aspects of development progression, during 2024:

### Worlds

* Finished Bonus Island 1 remake.
* Started work on the Bonus Island 2 remake.
* First 2 worlds of Story Mode have been remade entirely (with the worldmap only left to be entirely finished).

### Music

The game now includes tons of new music from various contributors. Credit to SnugglyBun, bruhmoent and Chitan.

### Features

* The introduction of the Item Pocket, replacing our previous Powerup Stacking mechanic with the aim to encourage more strategic gameplay.
* Improvements to Zeekling behaviour.
* Work on new Yeti boss behaviour has started, however it is currently work-in-progress.

Alongside that, many minor features and various improvements and bugfixes were made along the year!

### Future plans

Regarding the long-awaited release of v0.7.0, we apologize for not meeting the estimated release months we've announced in the past! Development has been active lately and we will do our best to release v0.7.0 in 2025! Thank you for your patience!

We plan to additionally do the following before v0.7.0:

* Merge all waiting Pull Requests on our repository, which are not drafts for the future or big reworks, not suiting our aim to try releasing during the year.
* Perform some testing and apply bugfixes when necessary.
* Call for contributors to help with translation on [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/).
* Revamp the Ghost Tree with new sprites and behaviour.
* Include even more new backgrounds.

Regarding the future after v0.7.0, check out our [Story Mode Roadmap](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Story-Mode-Roadmap) for Story Mode future progression plans!
