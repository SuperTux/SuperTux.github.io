#### Mobile Platforms (Android)

Right now, there is no official support for mobile platforms (e.g. Android). 
However, there are community-provided ports for some of these platforms.
**Since we do not own or control these, use of them is at your own discretion.**
Also, it might be possible that these ports are out of date or have a limited
set of features. SuperTux is also not available for iOS and most likely never will be.
