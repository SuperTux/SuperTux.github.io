#### WebAssembly

If you want to add SuperTux to your personal website, you may do so with these files.

Make sure to check the README.txt file inside the archive for instructions on how to setup your server to run SuperTux properly. You may also find the details [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements). If you see an error saying that SharedArrayBuffers are missing, make sure you are using HTTPS and that the two headers are set.

#### Mobile Platforms (Android)

Right now, there is no official support for mobile platforms (e.g. Android). 
However, there are community-provided ports for some of these platforms.
**Since we do not own or control these, use of them is at your own discretion.**
Also, it might be possible that these ports are out of date or have a limited
set of features. SuperTux is also not available for iOS and most likely never will be.
