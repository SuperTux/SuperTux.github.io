### The Story: Penny Gets Captured!

Tux and Penny were out having a nice picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there was a flash, and Tux
fell asleep!

When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay before now lies
a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!" says the letter. "I have captured your beautiful
Penny and have taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered
with my minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't
got a chance! -Nolok"

Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to save his
beloved Penny, he begins his journey.
