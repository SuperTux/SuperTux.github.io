## Contact

Here are the many ways you can contact the team. Usually we will answer quite
quickly, but if we don't, please be patient and give us the benefit of the
doubt. Yes, that means stick around Discord or IRC longer than 10 minutes. ;)

### Social Networks

You can follow us on some social networks to receive updates! Also, feel free to
get in touch with us using them.

### Discord

The [SuperTux Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AcvtHWz) is a place, where you can showcase
your SuperTux works, ask the SuperTux Team your questions, keep up to date with new features
and announcements, and chat with other fans. We are waiting for you!

### Forum

We also have a [forum](https://groups.f-hub.org/g/8AKEaTgZ) where
you can discuss the game, ask questions and submit your creations or
contributions.

### IRC

Most development related discussions that need to happen in real time happen on
IRC. You can find us on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) (server:
irc.libera.chat) in the [#supertux](ircs://irc.libera.chat/#supertux)
channel. Please note that people might not be available all day, so wait before
you leave.
